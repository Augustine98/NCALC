# NCALC
A Numerical Calculator written in C++(88) for use in the Disk Operating System

Overview of the project
N-Calc is a scientific calculator, which provides features to handle matrices (maximum
size 4x4) and plot various second degree equations in a very user friendly environment,
enabling the use of a mouse. Behind the screen, the calculator has a strong
computational foundation, following the PEMDAS rule, functions are implemented in the
post-fix form to avoid ambiguity. The graphing section of the calculator allows the user
to analyze the entered equation by providing context-based menus and plotting the
point, or line, if possible. The accuracy of these values have been thoroughly tested and
can handle any situation. Under the matrix label, the calculator comes with functions to
find the adjoint, determinant, transpose etc. of a matrix.

Goals
I. To build a fully functional Scientific calculator which provides graphing
functionalities.
II. To make the interface smooth and user-friendly.

To do
I. Add the ability to plot multiple graphs at the same time.
II. Add the feature to resize the window, change colour etc.
III. Add the ability to plot any function.
IV. To implement the entire calculator symbolically.

User Instructions
I. Make sure that the path for the graphics library is correct.
II. Ensure that you enter the values in the right data type, and according to the
specified restrictions.
III. Always enter values, considering the domain of the function.For example, log(0)
will give an error.
